A transistor amplifier circuit is an electronic circuit that uses one or more transistors to amplify an input signal. The basic operation of a transistor amplifier circuit involves using a small input signal to control a larger output signal.

The input signal is typically too weak to be used directly, but the transistor acts as an amplifier to increase the signal strength. There are various types of transistor amplifier circuits, such as common emitter, common collector, and common base, each with different advantages and disadvantages.

Transistor amplifier circuits are widely used in electronics for applications such as audio amplifiers, radio receivers, and power supplies.

Feature of Transistor Amplifier Circuit - 

1. High gain: Transistors can provide high voltage and current gain, which makes them ideal for amplifying weak signals.

2. Low distortion: Transistors have low distortion characteristics, which helps preserve the quality of the input signal during amplification.

3. Variable gain control: The gain of transistor amplifier circuits can be easily adjusted by changing the biasing conditions of the transistor.

4. High input impedance: The input impedance of a transistor amplifier is typically high, which helps prevent loading of the input signal source.

5. Low output impedance: The output impedance of a transistor amplifier is typically low, which enables the amplifier to drive a load with minimal loss of signal.

6. Small size: Transistor amplifier circuits can be made in small sizes due to the compact size of the transistors themselves.

7. Low power consumption: Transistor amplifier circuits consume less power compared to other types of amplifiers, making them energy efficient.

8. High reliability: Transistors are known for their high reliability and long life, making them suitable for use in various applications.
Overall, transistor made amplifier circuits are versatile, efficient, and reliable, making them a popular choice in many electronic circuits.


Connect Resistor with Circuit - 

To make this powerful amplifier circuit, 1st we connect resistor with the transistor. We connect 1k resistor with "Base" and "Collector" leg of C5198 transistor. Then connect 100k resistor with "Emitter" leg of A1941 transistor and it's another terminal with "Base" leg of C2383 transistor.


Connect Diode with Circuit - 

Now we need to connect diode with the circuit. We are using two pieces 4148 diode. We connect this diode positive terminal with "Base" leg of C5198 transistor. Then connect this diode negative terminal with another diode positive leg. Then connect it's empty terminal of another diode connect with "Base" leg of A1941 transistor.

Please remember that, we might need to connect C2383 "Collector" leg with "Base" leg of A1941 transistor.


Connect Capacitor with Circuit -

Capacitor is a part and parcel of an amplifier circuit. 1st we connect 470uF/25v capacitor negative leg with "Collector" leg of A1941 transistor and the capacitor positive leg with "Collector" leg of C5198 transistor.


Now we connect the rest capacitor with the circuit. We connect 2200uF/25v capacitor positive leg with "Emitter" leg of A1941 transistor.
Then connect 220uF/25v capacitor positive leg with "Base" leg of C2383 transistor and it's negative terminal will be empty.


Connect Speaker with Circuit - 

For this sound system, we are using 4Ω-40 watt speaker. We connect this sound speaker one terminal with negative leg of 2200uF/25v capacitor and the other terminal with "Emitter" leg of C2383 transistor.


Connect Audio Input Cable with Circuit -

Now we connect audio input "R" cable with negative leg of 220uF/25v capacitor and audio input "G" cable with "Emitter" leg of C2983 transistor.


Connect Power Source with Circuit -

For power source we are using DC-12v. You also can use 12v battery or 12v power adaptor. We connect DC-12v positive terminal with "Collector" leg of C5498 transistor and DC-12v negative terminal with "Emitter" leg of C2383 transistor.


Soldering and Cleaning -

Neat and perfect soldering is an important part for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. After soldering all leg, we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component.

We also can use liquid PCB cleaner to clean the PCB board.
